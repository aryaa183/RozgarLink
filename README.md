**RozgarLink — Daily Wage Worker Support System**

Empowering India's daily wage workers by connecting them with local short-term job opportunities.

📌 About The Project
RozgarLink is a Flutter-based mobile application developed as part of the Programming Skills Development Laboratory mini project. It addresses the real-world problem of unstable work for daily wage laborers in India by creating a digital platform that connects workers with short-term local job opportunities.
The app supports two user roles — Worker and Employer — and provides features like real-time job listings, skill-based matching, shift scheduling, skill training, and mock payment tracking.

💡 Social Impact
RozgarLink addresses a critical problem faced by millions of daily wage workers in India:

🏗️ No stable work — Workers struggle to find consistent daily employment
